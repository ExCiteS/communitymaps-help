## What are contributions?

Each project has categories, and every category has contributions which have been added to that project. Yet again, each contribution can contain text information, images and videos, also comments.

Contributions are added by contributors of a project. If project’s settings allow it, every person accessing that project can be a contributor.

## How do they look like?

Added contributions can be visible on a map: either as the shape of [an area](#areas), [a line](#lines), or [a simple point](#points).

### Points

Points are used for mapping single spots on a map. They are visualised as markers with a colour of a category used, also an optional icon.

When there are too many points next to each other, they are grouped into *clusters*. A number on each cluster indicates how many points are grouped together. As you zoom out, points are assigned to fewer clusters. When you zoom in, more clusters appear.

### Lines

Lines are used for mapping paths, roads, etc. When visualised, they only have a colour of a category used for that contribution.

When drawing a line on a map, points are added alongside the path. Those points are then connected together to form a single line. The shape is finished with a mouse click on a last point.

### Areas

For mapping bigger spaces on a map - areas are used. When visualised, shapes of areas also have only a colour of a category set on them.

Drawing an area is very similar to line. The only difference is that the last point of the shape is the first point added. Also areas have backgrounds with the same colour as category chosen.

## What can be uploaded?

Every contribution can have pictures, videos, documents and audio files attached to it. They can be viewed by anyone with access to the map, but only the creator of that contribution and map moderators can add new media.

Additional media can be uploaded either while adding a new contribution, or when the contribution has already been added to the project. Also, any media can be removed from the contribution.

## Let's upload!

Multiple media files can be selected either manually, or by dragging and dropping them on the drop area.

Before the file is uploaded to our servers, it is added to a list of new files. You can change the name of a file, and add an optional description. Each file can then be uploaded individually or altogether.

The following types of file type are supported by us:
* ***Pictures***

o	PNG

o	JPEG

* ***Videos***

o	MP4

o	MKV

* ***Documents***

o	PDF

* ***Audio***

o	MP3

### Pictures

Uploaded pictures appear on the list of media files straight away. They can be viewed when accessing the contribution’s media tab.

The creator of a contribution or moderator of the whole project can delete uploaded pictures at any time. Once deleted, pictures cannot be recovered.

### Videos

Videos take time to process. Even though they are visible on videos that are uploaded will be uploaded to our private YouTube account.

### Documents

Documents (pdf) can be uploaded and viewed straight away. They can also be downloaded to your computer.

### Audio files

All audio files are available to play straight away. However, 3gpp and 3gpp2 are converted to mp3 format due to browser compatibility.

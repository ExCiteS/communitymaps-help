We ask that you read this privacy notice carefully as it contains important information on who we are, how and why we collect, store, use and share personal information, your rights in relation to your personal information and on how to contact us and supervisory authorities if you have a complaint.

## Who we are

Mapping for Change CIC ("We") collects, uses and is responsible for certain personal information about you. When we do so we are regulated under the General Data Protection Regulation which applies across the European Union (including in the United Kingdom) and we are responsible as 'controller' of that personal information for the purposes of those laws.

## The personal information we collect and use

To register you as a user of Community Maps, we collect the following personal information when you provide it to us:
- Your name
- Your postcode
- Your email address
- Your telephone number(s)

We want to provide you with the best user experience when using our site so collect certain technical information, including, where available, your IP address; operating system; and browser type, for system administration and monitoring purposes. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual, nor will we make any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our websites.

## How we use your personal information

We will use your personal data to:
- Verify your identity and validate your Community Maps registration.
- To enable you to log-in and access or contribute to Community Maps.
- To ensure that you receive feedback and responses to matters that you have raised.
- To ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.
- To provide you with information or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes.
- To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so.
- To notify you about changes to our service.

## Who we share your personal information with

We will share personal information with law enforcement or other authorities if required by applicable law. We limit access to your personal information to third-party services for the operation of our service. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorised manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

## How long your personal information will be kept

We will hold your personal data for the duration in which your Community Maps account is maintained.

## Reasons we can collect and use your personal information

When you register as a user of Community Maps, we seek your consent to the processing of your data as outlined above.  We rely on this consent as the lawful basis on which we collect and use your personal data.

## Your rights

Under the [General Data Protection Regulation](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN) you have a number of important rights free of charge. In summary, those include rights to:
- access to your personal information and to certain other supplementary information that this Privacy Notice is already designed to address
- require us to correct any mistakes in your information which we hold
- require the erasure of personal information concerning you in certain situations
- receive the personal information concerning you which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to a third party in certain situations
- object at any time to processing of personal information concerning you for direct marketing
- object to decisions being taken by automated means which produce legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affect you
- object in certain other situations to our continued processing of your personal information
- otherwise restrict our processing of your personal information in certain circumstances

For further information on each of those rights, including the circumstances in which they apply, see the [Guidance from the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) on individuals rights under the General Data Protection Regulation](http://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/).

If you would like to exercise any of those rights, please:
- email (info @ mappingforchange.org.uk), or write to us
- let us have enough information to identify you
- let us have proof of your identity and address (a copy of your driving licence or passport and a recent utility or credit card bill), and
- let us know the information to which your request relates.

You can find out if we hold any personal information about you by making a 'subject access request' under the Data Protection Act 1998. Any access request may be subject to a fee of Â£10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.

## Keeping your personal information secure

We have appropriate security measures in place to prevent personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way. We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so.

## Where we store your personal data

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our third-party service providers. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

Where you have chosen a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. Do not share your password with anyone and do not use a password that you have already used to access other websites or services.

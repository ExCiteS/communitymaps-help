## Let's start discussing!

Each contribution has a comments section, where everyone can discuss it. Comments are hierarchical, and they are represented with different colours:

* ***Blue*** - original comment
* ***Yellow*** - responses to comments.
* ***Green*** - your personal comments.

There are also ***orange*** comments which indicate that an issue has been reported.

## What are reports?

When something is not right with a contribution, anyone can inform administrators and moderators of the issue. Contributions are not visible to the public, until all the issues have been resolved.

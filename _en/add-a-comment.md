## Let's start discussion!

Each contribution has a comments section where everyone can discuss. Comments are hierarchical, also they are indicated with different colours:

* ***Green*** - your personal comments.
* ***Blue*** - parent comment of a hierarchy (unless the comment is yours).
* ***Yellow*** - replies to comments.

There are also ***orange*** comments. They indicate reports.

## What are reports?

When something is not right with contribution, everyone has the right to inform administrators and moderators of the project about the issues. Contributions are still visible to the public, but can then be suspended until all the issues have been resolved.

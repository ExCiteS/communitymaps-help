## Can I contribute?

If project’s settings allow it, every person accessing that project can be a contributor. Sometimes administrators of a project can restrict contributing either to registered users or only to some specific users.

## Let's contribute!

### Step 1: Drawing a shape

The first step when adding a new contribution is to draw the shape of it on the map: it can either be [a point](/en/overview-of-contributions.html#points), [a line](/en/overview-of-contributions.html#lines), or [an area](/en/overview-of-contributions.html#areas) - whether is best representing current information. Only one shape can be drawn for each contribution.

Please note that the drawn shape **can** be changed and edited once contribution has been added to the project.

### Step 2: Choosing a category

We already know that every contribution belongs to a category, so the second step is to choose one for a new contribution. The list of categories shows all active categories that can be used, also how many fields have been added on each category.

When a chosen category is selected, all the fields of that category are loaded to the form.

Please note that the chosen category **cannot** be changed once contribution has been added to the project.

### Step 3: Completing a form

On the last step, a form must be filled in.

All the required fields can be left empty *only* if contribution is saved as a draft. Otherwise a notification is displayed and field is highlighted.

There can be different fields on a form: text field, number field, single lookup and multiple lookup fields, also date and time fields. Appropriate information *must be* provided for each field, otherwise a notification is displayed and field is also highlighted.

![Invalid fields of a category](/images/en/contributing-invalid-fields.png){: .img-responsive .center-block }

Anonymous users can only add contribution to the project, but registered users are also allowed to save it as a draft. Draft contributions can later be finished and added to the project.

Please note that media files **can** be added either during the contributing process or when contribution is already added to the project.

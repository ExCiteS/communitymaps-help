## Use the map

When the project is loaded, contributions are displayed on the map. We already know that they can be visible either as the shape of [a point](/en/overview-of-contributions.html#points), [a line](/en/overview-of-contributions.html#lines), or [an area](/en/overview-of-contributions.html#areas). Every shape is a hyperlink to that contribution.

The currently active contribution is highlighted on the map: if it’s a point, it has a hover around it, otherwise the colour of contribution changes to bright yellow.

Clicking on a highlighted contribution centres the view. Clicking  anywhere else on the map closes the active contribution and returns to the project. From here, other ways of accessing contributions can be explored.

## Apply filters

We already know that every contribution belongs to a category, and every category usually has a different icon and colour to separate contributions visually on the map. This is visible on the list of categories.

Every category can be checked or unchecked. That’s how contributions on the map are toggled - this is called *filtering by categories*.

But filters can do even more magic. With the same technique of checking and unchecking *statuses*, it is possible to visualise only active, for example, or only contributions which are in review, also switching between personal and all contributions of a project.

### But what are those "statuses"?

For management of contributions, we are using four statuses:

* ***Active*** - those are all approved contributions which are visible to everyone who has access to a project.
* ***Pending*** - contributions with this status can be seen only by moderators of a project or creators of those contributions. Contributions can be pending either when project’s settings require all newly added contributions to be checked by moderators before allowing them to be accessible, or when the problem has been reported and moderator decided to suspend the contribution.
* ***Review*** - those are also publicly visible contributions but with a problem reported by someone.
* ***Draft*** - only creators can see unfinished and publicly not yet accessible contributions.

## Use list of contributions and search

Contributions currently visualised on the map are listed on a list of contributions. They have a clickable display field, also category, author and when the contribution was created is shown under each contribution.

When searching for specific contributions, the found term is highlighted, and only contributions that match the search criteria are displayed on the map.

## Edit contribution

You can edit your own contributions (or all contributions, if you’re a moderator of the project), at any time.

## Delete media files

Every added media file can be deleted by the creator of a contribution, or moderator of the whole project.

## Delete comments

Every comment can be deleted. You can delete either your personal comments from any contribution, or any comment from your contributions. Comments that have reports in their hierarchy cannot be deleted until the issue is closed.
